# Flag duplicates using cosine distance
def find_duplicates(image, thresh=1e-3):
    """
    Function for finding pair of duplicates in an array.
    As all samples combination pairs needs to be tested , I decided to use cosine distance among samples as it is fast to compute.
    A threshold is used for deciding if samples are same or not. Found 1e-3 to work the best.

    Parameters:
        image                         (numpy array) : 2D array of shape (n_files, flattened_image_pixels)
        threshold for cosine distance (float)       : threshold for deciding duplicate or not.

    Returns:
        bool numpy array of shape (n_files, n_files)

    image_unit = image / np.linalg.norm(image, ord=2, axis=1, keepdims=True)    # Convert images to unit vectors
    image_distances = 1 - image_unit @ image_unit.T                             # Calculate cosine distance among images
    return image_distances < thresh                                             # Using 0.0001 distance as threshold to call it a duplicate image


def check_folder(folder, compare_size=300):
    """
    Function for reading all the files inside the folder and comparing them.

    Parameters:
        folder       (directory_path) : Path to the folder that needs to be checked.
        compare_size (int)            : All images will be resized to this size for comparison. 
                                        Higher consumes memory and Low can lead to inaccurate results. 
                                        300 is a good spot which means every image will be resized to 300 X 300.
    Returns:
        array of the file path that are duplicate.
